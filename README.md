java-configuration
==================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mediascience/java-configuration.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mediascience/java-configuration)

Simple environment-based configuration for Java.

## Usage

### Import to Project
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.msiops.garage</groupId>
    <artifactId>garage-configuration</artifactId>
    <version>${v.configuration}</version>
</dependency>
```

See [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%20%22com.msiops.garage%22%20a%3A%22garage-configuration%22) for latest version

### Load Properties
```java
// environment name is in sysprop "garage.environment"
// default environment is "development"

// properties loaded from resource, "{environment}.properties"
// in class's package.
final Properties props = Configuration.of(MyClass.class);

// with defaults
final Properties props = Configuration.of(MyClass.class, defProps);
```

### Override Properties
```java
final Properties props = ...
final Collection<String> overrides = Arrays.asList("sys.prop", "sys.other.prop");

// any matching system properties override
final Properties overridden = Configuration.override(props, overrides);


final Properties addl = ...
// any matching properties from source override
final Properties overridden2 = Configuration.override(props, overrides, addl);


final Map<String,String> spec = Collections.singletonMap("USER", "my.app.user");
// env USER value is added to props as "my.app.user"
final Properties overridden2 = Configuration.overrideFromEnv(props, spec);
```

### Detach
```java
Properties p = new Properties();
p.setProperty("key","value");

Properties detached = Configuration.detach(p);
p.setProperty("key","changed");
assert detached.getProperty("key").equals("value");
```

### Partial Properties Map
```java
Properties p = new Properties();
p.setProperty("base.a", "avalue");
p.setProperty("base.b", "bvalue");

Map<String,String> partial = Configuration.asMap(p, "base");
assert partial.get("a").equals("avalue");
assert partial.get("b").equals("bvalue");
```


## Versioning

Releases in the 0.x series are the Wild West. Anything can change between
releases--package names, method signatures, behavior, whatever. But if you
like it as it is right now, all the tests pass so just use it at its current
version and have fun.

The next version series will be 1.x. Every release in that series will be
backward compatible with every lower-numbered release in the same series
except possibly in the case of 1) a bug fix or 2) a correction to an
underspecification.

An incompatible change to the interface, behavior, license, or anything else
after the 1.x series is published will result in a new series, such as
2.x.
